Yeah, I know.... What the hell do these two abbreviations even mean and how are they connected?

Stay tuned and you'll find out in this episode of

## Basic logic of advertising

So in order for advertising to work, we need two things
- a **product** that the producing company wants to advertise
- a **space** where this product can be advertised to other people

Okay, simple enough.

What do I mean by a _product_? 
A product can basically be anything, some examples are: CocaCola, the new HotWheels toy race car or Super Mario's new game... You name it...
These companies are in advertising jargon usually called **brands**.

What do I mean by a _space_?
You probably now what I'm thinking... mobile ads... Yeah, of course I was thinking about that and so were you, but we also have other spaces 
where we can advertise on; city billboards, T-Shirts, newspapers, even movies. 
We live in a world where we don't even notice something is being advertised as it's already embedded into our lives to such extent that we automatically ignore it.
For example while driving on the highway, most of the times you don't even notice the billboard on the nearby field. 
Well unless you're bored to death and even the clouds seem interesting.

Alrighty then, so now we have a product and we have a space.

The owner of the advertising space is called a *publisher*. 
Mobile games are usually publishers, since they are advertising other products. Some games also want to be advertised in other games, websites, videos..., 
this method is called **user acquisition** and is very common during a launch of a newly game.   
Someone that advertises a product is called an **advertiser**.
Advertiser is usually a third party agency also known as an **ad provider** (from publisher's point of view), 
but it can also be the company that owns the advertised product; the term for latter is called a **direct** deal,
since product company and publisher make a deal without the middle man.
Direct deal example can be that Outfit7 has a deal with LEGO and in My Talking Tom there are bunch of rewarded videos for Lego Technic toys.

## DSP and SSP

The direct deals are not that common which means we have the middle man present.
The middle man is not a bad guy in this story, on the contrary, 
he's quite helpful since he ensures publishers always have enough products to advertise 
and advertises have enough space to advertise their products.
