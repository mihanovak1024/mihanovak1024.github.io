Yeah, I know.... What the hell do these two abbreviations even mean and how are they connected?

Stay tuned and you'll find out in this episode of

## Basic Advertising Logic

So in order for advertising to work, we need two things
- a **product** the owning company wants to advertise
- a **space** where this product can be advertised to other people

</figure>

Okay, simple enough.

What do I mean by a _product_? 
A product can basically be anything, some examples are: CocaCola, the new HotWheels toy race car, Super Mario's new game or a new social app called InstaFaceGramBook... You name it...
The companies behind these products are in advertising jargon usually called **brands**.

What do I mean by a _space_?
You're probably thinking about... mobile ads... Well I sure was, but there are also other spaces 
where advertising can appear on; city billboards, radio stations, newspapers, T-Shirts, even movies. 

We live in a world where we don't even notice something is being advertised as it's already embedded into our lives to such extent that we automatically ignore it.
For example while driving on the highway, most of the time you don't even notice the billboard on the nearby field. 
Well unless you're bored to death so that even the clouds seem interesting.

Alrighty then, so now we have a product and we have a space.

The owner of the advertising space is called a *publisher*. 
Mobile games are usually publishers, since they are advertising other products. They do this to get some revenue, since an advertiser pays the publisher to advertise. 
Some games also want to be advertised in other games, websites, videos..., 
this method is called **user acquisition** and is very common during a launch of a newly game.   

Someone that advertises a product is called an **advertiser**.
Advertiser is usually a third party agency also known as an **ad provider** (from publisher's point of view), 
but it can also be the company that owns the advertised product; the term for latter is called a **direct** deal,
since product company and publisher make a deal without the middle man.
Direct deal example can be that Outfit7 has a deal with LEGO and in My Talking Tom there are bunch of rewarded videos for Lego Technic toys.

Side note: from the upper image it's not certain whether TikTok and Voodoo are having a direct deal 
or TikTok is being advertised to Voodoo's Helix Jump by a third party agency.

## DSP and SSP

The direct deals are not that common meaning the middle man is usually present.
Though the middle man is not a bad guy in this story, on the contrary, 
he's quite helpful since he ensures publishers always have enough products to advertise 
and advertises have enough space to advertise their products.

The middle guy I'm referring to is the <b style="color:#C1A1D3">pink rectangle</b> in the upper picture.

As you can see from the the upper picture, it also includes **DSP** and **SSP**.
So what are they?  

Well they stand for
- Demand Side Platform
- Supply Side Platform

and as the names suggest, one is responsible for demand (brand product) and the other for supply (publisher space).

### DSP

So lets talk a bit about the Demand Side Platform aka DSP.
