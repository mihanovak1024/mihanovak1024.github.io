Nowadays ads pop up on every corner of our life; in a supermarket, on a newspaper, tv and your very own pocket computer also known as a mobile device.

I'll be focusing purely on the mobile ecosystem; so here it goes.

Mobile advertisement got stronger with better mobile devices on the market; a better device means better hardware and software,
which leads to more sophisticated ads; from static images to interactive ads to video and finally playables.
Yes, **playables**; ads where you actually play a mini/demo game embedded into an ad view, which triggers your interest of the advertised game and you actually install it.

## From 2010 onwards
Ads were present from the very beginning of smartphone existence.

### Ad Types

Since there were constraints of mobile data transfer limits and internet speed, the ads weren't as beautiful as they are nowadays (although it doesn't make them any less annoying).
Advertising agencies needed to adapt to the device limits at that time, thus only certain ad types were meaningful; the ones that were the most optimised in terms of size and complexity.
The most popular ad type at that time were **banners**, since they were had small sizes and were lightweight. 

Other types, such as videos, were quite tricky for advertisers since there was such a huge spectre of different screen sizes and resolutions.
Video format gained popularity in the later years when mobile devices became better and mobile data transfer became cheaper and more attainable in the broader public.  

Along with everything else that was different from today, banners also looked quite poorly compared to the ones used nowadays.
Here's an example of Google Maps in-app advertisement:

As companies noticed the rise of smartphone popularity, quite a few mobile advertisement agencies and ad networks were born in 2010.
Each company wanted to get a leading edge in the sea of competition in advertisement space, thus each introduced new or improved concepts.
A good example is InMobi's [introduction to tablet banners](https://www.inmobi.com/blog/2010/11/24/Introducing-Banners-for-Tablets-Including-iPads): "_Introducing Banners For Tablets Including IPads_",
since tablets like Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy Tab started to get popular.

Rich media ads started to pop up, though in 2010 they were still treated as experimental.
What are rich media ads, you ask? Well they are essentially ads that give the user a more rich experience; 
they offer more in-app interactivity via video, sound, gaming and so on.

### Mobile vs Web

Advertisers were quite confused whether they should spend their money on web, mobile apps or both, 
since web mobile apps started to gain popularity. Along with advertisers, the developing companies were also a bit confused
since they didn't know whether they should focus on mobile web apps or mobile native apps.

The popularity was driven by the shorter and cheaper development cycle, since companies wouldn't need 
native Android and iOS developers, instead they would just have one proficient web developer with basic knowledge
of native Android and iOS to make a functional mobile web app. 

### Ad Spending

You know things started to get serious when Google makes their move.
In 2010 Google created a blog with the title "[_Weâ€™ve officially acquired AdMob!_](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/weve-officially-acquired-admob.html)".
If, by any chance, you didn't know this: AdMob is currently (2021) one of the largest, if not the largest, mobile ad networks in mobile advertisement space.


Mobile ad spending reached it's highs each year, causing many articles similar to this one:

From the same article the following analysis was made to forecast mobile ad spending in the following years:

## Ads in 2020

From 2018 to 2020 the quality of mobile devices started to increase and Apple finally got a bit of competition.
Up until this point Apple was considered as a premium mobile device provided, but companies like Samsung, OnePlus, ... started
producing their own high end smartphones getting closer to Apple in terms of device quality, performance and even price range.
