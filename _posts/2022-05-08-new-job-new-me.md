Since the failed startup I had to get a new job. 
There was (probably) an opportunity to ask my previous manager if they would take me back,
but I wanted to see the world, so I looked for something new, something fresh. Oh, so very fresh.

# Something Fresh
After 7 years withing Android's ecosystem, I figured there might be other ecosystem just as or, dare I say, even more amusing.

I started to look around and somehow stumbled upon <b style="color:#00adb5">Frontend</b>, bought a new empty notebook and started learning. 
Notebook, you may wonder. It's just my kind of learning style.

You can check more about the learning process on my [previous blog post](/learning/learning-a-new-stack/).

# The Email
I started learning React through tutorials.
During the learning period I got an email from an HR manager asking if I'd be willing to give <b style="color:#00adb5">Turtl</b> a try.

I already heard about [Turtl](https://turtl.co/) about 2 years ago and I've roughly seen what they're about. 
Their idea was quite on point and I was interested on their product.

The email pitch was very <b style="color:#00adb5">unique</b> and it was fun to read. It was on par with my writing style and it struck as sincere.

## BUT...
But there was one small detail...

... their stack includes neither Android nor React, but <b style="color:#00adb5">Angular</b>.

I didn't know anything about Angular, as I just started dipping my toes in React.
The email, however, stated that no prior experience in Angular is needed and every good engineer can deep dive into any technology.

# Coffee
I followed the CTO in Turtl on Twitter and he seemed like a very approachable guy, 
so before replying to the email I met him in person so he can tell me more
and ensure me that my lack of Angular knowledge is not a deal breaker.

Everything went smoothly and he hooked me to the Turtl product even more.

# Almost There
After 2 weeks of interviews, bureaucracy and a medical exam, I got an official date for my first day in Turtl.
I had 2 weeks left, before I started, so I wanted to make them <b style="color:#00adb5">count</b>.

I turned my (mostly empty) React notebook upside down and wrote the title <b style="color:#00adb5">"Angular"</b>.
I started with [Schwarzmuller's Angular course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2) on Udemy (which I highly recommend), 
did the assignments and took notes.

After the course I was slightly more confident I can do all this fresh, new stuff that will "haunt" me for the next few years.
In a <b style="color:#00adb5">positive</b> manner, of course ;)

# Turtl
I have been welcomed to Turtl very nicely and the first few chats I had with my manager (now the new CTO) and the team, 
I knew I'm in the right company.

But the company is 7 years old, it has a <b style="color:#00adb5">laaaarge</b> Frontend codebase written in both AngularJS and Angular.
It was a challenge of it's own.

I was confused by everything the first 2 weeks, asked dumb questions and talked to my manager a lot.
After a month now, I can say I'm still a bit confused, but I'm starting to get a hang of it.

# The Learning Continues
Now that I could see what technologies they are using, I started to learn the basics of <b style="color:#00adb5">everything</b>.

## Videos
I subscribed to [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) channel and checked all relevant videos:
- CSS (Grid vs Flex)
- Express
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- npm

## Reading
I read:
- Javascript through history
- Angular through history
- Angular state management (ngxs vs ngrx)

I also deep dived into Javascript by checking all <b style="color:#00adb5">ES6 stuff</b> and reading the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/),
which I highly recommend for beginner to upper mid Frontend developers.

## Project
As with any other new skill you want to master, getting your hands dirty is a must.

I'm planning to create a SaaS app with the <b style="color:#00adb5">MEAN</b> stack to understand how it works.

The app should include:
- User login
- Session persisting
- Live chat (probably with long polling)
- File saving

I just need to check some other stuff a bit before I dive deep into this one.

## Plan
There's a few more things I want to do:
- Read the whole Angular documentation
- Join the [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)
- Read [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

## While Working
There are a lot of challenges in Turtl and I'm very excited to tackle each and every one.
I'm learning new stuff <b style="color:#00adb5">day by day</b> and everyone is being really helpful.

I already learned (beginner-ish) stuff like:
- CSS's Specificity
- Angular Component's event performance
- Finding the DOM element's :hover section in Developer Tools
- The difference between `||` and `??` for specific cases
- Using LoDash library

# Conclusion
I'm really glad I joined such an awesome company and I really try getting better and better every day.
I see progress daily, both in terms of my Frontend technical skills and Turtl's codebase understanding.

I can <b style="color:#00adb5">hardly</b> wait to face all the challenges thrown at my way.
