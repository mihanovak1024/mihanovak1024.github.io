It's already been a year and a half from the first <a href="/portfolio/highlightra">Highlightra</a> commit.
I can't believe how much time flies. There was a lot of progress with it, but for the past few months it has been idle,
because I a different sidegig came along the way.

# What it was like doing my first SaaS

I must say it's been the first time doing a SaaS by myself and equipping it with
- authentication
- payment
- analytics
from the technical perspective.

It's also been the first time I went into a bit more details with creating a landing page and all the content it needs to include.

Everything was very exciting and looking back I don't see anything being a waste of time.

I learned what it takes to set up a SaaS; from Cloudflare, to deploying on DigitalOcean, to setting analytic funnels and so on.

# Twitter engagemenet

While I was building Highlightra, I was trying to be a active on Twitter.

Before I was just casually scrolling through it, but I never engaged in anything.

This all changed with Highlightra, and I was posting, engaging with other people publicly and messaging them privately, all this on daily basis.

I saw the impact this had on my Twitter analytics.

Like with other stuff, I didn't stick to it as it's very time consuming the way I envisioned it.

What I learned from this is that being a preacher on Twitter is hard. You need to come up with a lot of quality content.

I like the approach other people have, like Pieter Levels, who just post whatever is on their mind.

I'll try to get back to being active on Twitter, it was fun while I stayed commited to it.

# What's in store for the future

Highlightra as a project is ready for initial users. 
I need to do a marketing push for this, which consists of:
- posting in FB group Growth Hacking Slovenia for initial feedback
- posting in FB group Slovenski Developerji for initial feedback
- doing a ProductHunt launch
- posting in Subreddits
- posting on IndieHackers
- marketing it on Twitter

So the plan is there, I just need to find time to do it.

After the initial feedback, I'll see whether this project has potential of being something bigger.
