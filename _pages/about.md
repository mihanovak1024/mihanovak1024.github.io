My name is <b style="color:#00adb5">Miha Novak</b> (it's a **male** name, I kid you not), and I'm a 26-year-old Software Engineer based in Slovenia, Europe.

I've been programming professionally since my **20th** birthday.

In the last year I have been working on a startup with a friend, developing a home-based arm exercising tool for post-stroke patients, called <a href="/portfolio/homeclinico" target="_blank">HomeClinico</a>. 
Previous 6 years I was working in Ad Technology space witnessing <b style="color:#00adb5">world class</b> trends in Mobile Advertisement sphere.

The number <b style="color:#00adb5">1024</b> next to my name comes from a codename that my University entitled me with and I was so fond of it, 
I decided to use it everywhere, so it kind of became my signature.

# Interests

My passion is tackling interesting problems the company is facing and helping to <b style="color:#00adb5">grow</b> their <b style="color:#00adb5">revenue</b> streams.
I love building solutions that have a direct impact on revenue, since it's the most important metric for every company to have.

I'd consider myself a generalist as I like to get my hands dirty on all fronts. 
Being a generalist also lets me interconnect the best practices of every field.
You can read more about this on the <a href="#career-switch">bottom</a> of this page.

## Serious Projects
Currently I only have one serious project in my arsenal; <a href="/portfolio/homeclinico" target="_blank">HomeClinico</a>.
It is a startup/side-project that's solving a problem of COVID-19 and the lack of physiotherapists.
HomeClinico is a home-based arm exercising tool for post-stroke patients and elderly with daily guided exercises. 

## Prototypes
I like to tinker around different programming challenges and try to prototype my ideas.
To name a few:
- a RBPi brains of an automatic beer dispenser + Android app for payments/statistics + BE server
- an automated YouTube music decoder and downloader with Google Spreadsheet integration called [Jukebox Transporter](https://github.com/mihanovak1024/jukebox-transporter)
- a Flutter Counter app called [CountOnMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topappfield.CountOnMe) (group project)
- an automated Slovenian real estate scrapper on a DigitalOcean droplet + Android app

and for everything I've received from the community, I wanted to give a little back,
thus the idea for [Programmer's guide Slovenia](https://github.com/mihanovak1024/programmers-guide-slovenia) was born (and well appreciated too).
Since there were several requests from people without Facebook accounts, I did a [Bookmarklet](https://github.com/mihanovak1024/fejstbukov-parser) for Facebook post extracting,
but due to Privacy concerns, it wasn't used.

As I had a rising interest in startups, I also read all of <b style="color:#00adb5">Paul Graham's</b> essays on startups and gathered notes of each essay on <a href="/portfolio/pg-essay-highlights" target="_blank">one place</a>.

A bit more detailed descriptions of the architectural design and flow of these programs can be seen on my <a style="font-size:1.3em" href="/portfolio"><b>Portfolio page</b></a>

## Professional Experience
I really do fell lucky and proud, at the same time, to work alongside such talented people for these amazingly successful companies: 
- [Infinum](https://infinum.com/) (Web/Mobile development agency --- Croatian employer of the year 2015 **and** 2019) - 2015
- [Outfit7](https://outfit7.com/) (the creator of Talking Tom **and** one of world's best Mobile Advertising Mediation) - 2015-2021

### Infinum
Back in 2015 I started my <b style="color:#00adb5">Android Engineer</b> journey at Infinum and I accumulated a hefty amount of Android development knowledge.
I worked on Android projects for clients alongside Infinum's artists, project leads, developers and clients.

I'm really thankful to my mentor [Željko Plesac](https://twitter.com/ZeljkoPlesac) who helped me kick start my Android career really fast.  

### Outfit7 
During my 6 year working experience in Outfit7, I've been responsible for <b style="color:#00adb5">technical Android side of Mobile advertisement</b>, 
and I've developed a great interest towards it to such extent that I've decided to write a whole [blog]({{ "/posts/" | relative_url }}) about it.
 
I became exposed to advanced topics of Digital Advertising Technology which include:
- <b style="color:#00adb5">Headerbidding</b>
- Ad Mediation
- <b style="color:#00adb5">Ad Revenue Optimisations</b>
- Server-to-server and SDK integrations
- Ad Creative Rendering Engine creation
 
In Outfit7 I built my own Android projects from ground up with initial technical specifications included
and even orchestrated some of the project cross-platform (backend, iOS) members. 
A few of my responsibilities:
- complete refactor of Server-to-Server Android Ad engine
- complete refactor of the legacy ad library to a new, more modular and testable approach
- creation of our very own <b style="color:#00adb5">Consent Management Platform</b> for several legislations such as GDPR TCF2.0, CCPA, COPPA,...
- prototype of <b style="color:#00adb5">Headerbidding</b> Ad solution in collaboration with MaxAds

Thanks to my great mentors and managers [Nevena Veljković](https://si.linkedin.com/in/nevena-veljkovic-a00961b8), Marko Pistotnik and <b style="color:#00adb5">Matic Standeker</b>,
I've advanced both mentally and professionally! Thanks for all the great advices and help, I really do appreciate it!

# Career Enhancement
Being an Android Engineer for the past **7 years**, I wanted to see what else is out there. 
I decided to check out other types of Mobile development (Flutter, iOS, React Native) in my free time, 
to see the tradeoffs of each and interconnect the concepts.
 
This career enhancement in Mobile ecosystem would be the best choice in order to really become an <b style="color:#00adb5">expert</b> 
and tackle any Mobile problem (or phone?) thrown in my face.
