Jure, a friend of mine, despite being an experienced programmer, agreed to team up with me on a project we'd do together.

While I started to brainstorm what we could build, he was already working on a project of his own
and proposed that I would join him and continue the development of his existing project.

The project he was working on was a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) tool mobile app that counted whatever the user wanted to count;
pushups, number of coffees, number of mountain peaks reached,... you name it. 
Consequentially it got the name <b style="color:#00adb5">Count On Me Counter</b>.

As I haven't really gotten my hands dirty with Flutter yet, I gladly joined the project.

mostly used for simultaneous Android and iOS development, 
but it also works with web, Windows and Mac. It's created and supported by Google.</font></i>

## Flutter Learning Process

Since the project really isn't a rocket-science type, it was quite a nut to crack;
I had to learn Flutter with zero previous experience.

The learning curve was not that steep since it has a simple UI design logic (Widgets) and Dart
seems pretty straightforward as well.

By checking Jure's existing codebase I got a hang of Flutter in two to three weeks and got 
proficient with it within a month.

## App Progress

From Jure's ~300 and my ~80 hour inputs, the app grew quite steadily and it was time for the first release.
The first version is present on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topappfield.CountOnMe&hl=en&gl=US) as of December 2020.

In the meantime Maja joined the project as a designer; she created the icon and some of the in app images.
We're now (January 2020) working on banner creatives to market our app on web and other mobile apps.


There are also planes being made where we could publish the app gain a bit more traction.
We're not expecting to be featured on Google Play or anything like that, but a few thousand downloads wouldn't hurt. 

## Project Takeaways

The main goal is not really to become rich from this app, but to gain some insights in areas we mostly don't have experience in.

We really learned a lot about:
- publishing an Android app
- creating a Flutter app
- marketing an Android app
- getting and responding to user feedback
- programming a hobby project from scratch by multiple people
- team management on a hobby project

I'm really excited to be part of the marketing as I'd really like to see what it's like to 
be on the other side of the table; an advertiser. This will really broaden my views
in the whole AdTech sphere.

The whole point of it was to:
- test the current team collaboration and atmosphere
- analyse the mobile app market and how to penetrate it
- test our marketing approaches
- get to know new stuff --- marketing, Flutter
<br> and last but not least <b style="color:#00adb5">have fun</b>

## RIP?

Nope, not yet, we're still collaborating and will continue building and testing the whole thing shortly.

Since this blog was bound to happen, the upper project went on-hold for a month.
