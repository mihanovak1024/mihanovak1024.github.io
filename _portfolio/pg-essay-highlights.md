44. Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas
One reason we had such a lame idea was that it was the first thing we thought of.
If you're going to spend years working on something, 
you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas, 
instead of going with the first that comes into your head.

At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change.
So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, 
and then at each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be the idea.

The solution is at the other end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good.
Ask yourself: is this something people will pay for? 
Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing people will pay most for?

Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas for two or three new startups. 
The articles are full of descriptions of problems that need to be solved.

If you want to learn what people want, read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People.

It's much easier to sell services than a product,
just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings than by selling recordings. 
But the margins are greater on products.

51.﻿Ideas for Startups

Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: 
"Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, 
cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. 
It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."

The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea. 
It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial idea is that, 
in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll come up with your real idea.

39. How to Start a Startup
Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, 
and here's an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one. 
Nothing evolves faster than markets. 
The fact that there's no market for startup ideas suggests there's no demand.

The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now.

There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: 
because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want.

In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn't want the product.
The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them 
and refine it based on their reactions.

It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use.

The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding, 
not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. 
So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it's probably a smart move.

The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. 
This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, 
raising seed capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.

Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. 
They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. 
How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. 
When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, 
you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. 
If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, 
then you've done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.

Basically, a VC is a source of money. 
I'd be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.

There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. 
If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. 
And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay you.

More generally, design your product to please users first, 
and then think about how to make money from it.

To make something users love, you have to understand them. 
And the bigger you are, the harder that is. 
So I say "get big slow." 
The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.

The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. 
I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. 
To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. 
They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, 
and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. 
But worst of all, they slow you down: 
instead of sticking your head in someone's office and checking out an idea with them, 
eight people have to have a meeting about it. 

The only reason to hire someone is to do something you'd like to do but can't.

So who should start a startup? 
Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, 
and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot 
instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.

53. How to Fund a Startup

During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not working, your competitors will be.
My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, 
and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. 
I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. 
Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend's house for dinner. 
I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.

The reason is that investors need to get their capital back. 
They'll only consider companies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could get bought or go public.

Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation. 
When someone buys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for it.

So when do you approach VCs? When you can convince them. 
If the founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn't hard to understand, 
you could approach VCs quite early. 
Whereas if the founders are unknown and the idea is very novel, 
you might have to launch the thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.

5. How to Work Hard
There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. 
You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three: 
you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard.

Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business in his era, 
but he was also among the hardest working. "I never took a day off in my twenties," he said. "Not one."

196. Billionaires Build

The ideal combination is the group of founders who are "living in the future" 
in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, 
and who are building something they themselves want.

All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted, 
and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant 
that more people would want these things in the future.

As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get more: 
build new features they want, seek out more people like them, 
get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. 
But these techniques all require some initial seed group of users.

"How do you know people want this?" 
The most convincing answer is "Because we and our friends want it." 
It's even better when this is followed by the news that you've already built a prototype, 
and even though it's very crude, your friends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth.

The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about your users. 
So if you want to prepare for your interview, 
one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're thinking. 
Which is what you should be doing anyway.

It's all about users. 
The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that grows fast, 
and the way to grow fast is to make what users want.

Startups usually win by making something so great that people recommend it to their friends.

7. The Fatal Pinch
Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it? 
Y Combinator tells founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever get.

159. How To Raise Money
A typical trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, 
then (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, 
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, 
raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.

Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.

154. How To Convince Investors
How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes? 
You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far.

A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, 
regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way.

153. Do Things That Don't Scale
The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. 
Nearly all startups have to. 
You can't wait for users to come to you. 
You have to go out and get them.

There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. 
One is a combination of shyness and laziness. 
They'd rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers 
and probably be rejected by most of them. 
But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing. 
The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first.
This can't be how the big, famous startups got started, they think. 
The mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth. 
We encourage every startup to measure their progress by weekly growth rate. 
If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% a week. 
And while 110 may not seem much better than 100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big the numbers get. 
After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after 2 years you'll have 2 million.

Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made. 
And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them.

It's not the product that should be insanely great, but the experience of being your user.

The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get.

Like paying excessive attention to early customers, 
fabricating things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups. 
You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, 
and you learn things you'd never have known otherwise.

Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf. 
We did that at Viaweb. When we approached merchants asking if they wanted to use our software to make online stores, 
some said no, but they'd let us make one for them. Since we would do anything to get users, we did. 
We felt pretty lame at the time. Instead of organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, 
we were trying to sell luggage and pens and men's shirts. 
But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do, 
because it taught us how it would feel to merchants to use our software. 
Sometimes the feedback loop was near instantaneous: 
in the middle of building some merchant's site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, 
so I'd spend a couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.

149. Startup = Growth
A startup is a company designed to grow fast.

You have to know that growth is what you're after. 
The good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into place. 
Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost every decision you face.

For a company to grow really big, it must 
(a) make something lots of people want, and 
(b) reach and serve all those people.

Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to have to think of something fairly novel. 
A startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market, 
and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.

The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases: 
There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing. 
As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, 
there's a period of rapid growth. 
Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. 
Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly 
because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves. 
Together these three phases produce an S-curve. 
The phase whose growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent. 
Its length and slope determine how big the company will be.

If there's one number every founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate. 
That's the measure of a startup. If you don't know that number, you don't even know if you're doing well or badly.

A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. 
If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. 
If you can only manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.
We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they can hit, 
and then just try to hit it every week. The key word here is "just." 
If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that number, they're successful for that week.

So you'll be willing for example to hire another programmer, 
who won't contribute to this week's growth 
but perhaps in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you more users. 
But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, 
and (b) you're sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers without hiring someone new.

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, 
whereas a company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x. 
A company making $1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a week 
will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, 
which is less than a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley. 
A startup that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a month.

Growth is why startups usually work on technology -- because ideas for fast growing companies are so rare 
that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, 
and technology is the best source of rapid change. 
Growth is why it's a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: 
growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. 
Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high
but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. 
Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: 
it lets them choose their growth rate. 
And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. 
To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too.

125. Organic Startup Ideas
The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question: what do you wish someone would make for you?

13. What Startups Are Really Like
Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete > application and ship it.

When you let customers tell you what they're after, 
they will often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as well what they're willing to pay for.

Fast iteration is the key to success.

When you can't get users, it's hard to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the product's simply bad.

116. Ramen Profitable
Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses.

If you're already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that 
(a) you can get at least someone to pay you, 
(b) you're serious about building things people want, and 
(c) you're disciplined enough to keep expenses low.

When these companies fail, it's usually because 
(a) people wouldn't pay for what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them, or the market wasn't ready yet, 
(b) the founders solved the wrong problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or 
(c) the company spent too much and burned through their funding before they started to make money.

A startup's destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick for not dying en route.

105. Startups in 13 Sentences
Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.

The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, 
but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched. 
Launching teaches you what you should have been building.

Launch fast and iterate.

Go out of your way to make people happy. They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see. 
In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't scale, 
because it's a way of learning about your users.

Most startups fail before they make something people want, 
and the most common form of failure is running out of money. 
So being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.

Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely changes your relationship with investors.

Nothing kills startups like distractions. 
The worst type are those that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.

Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, 
the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.

Even if you get demoralized, don't give up. 
You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up.

Understand your users. That's the key. 
The essential task in a startup is to create wealth; 
the dimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives; 
and the hardest part of that is knowing what to make for them. 
Once you know what to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are capable of that. 
Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this list. 
That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users. 
Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users. 
Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making something that makes a few people deeply happy. 
The most important reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it helps you understand your users. 
And understanding your users will even ensure your morale, 
because when everything else is collapsing around you, 
having just ten users who love you will keep you going.

86. Six Principles for Making New Things
I like to find 
(a) simple solutions 
(b) to overlooked problems 
(c) that actually need to be solved, and 
(d) deliver them as informally as possible, 
(e) starting with a very crude version 1, then 
(f) iterating rapidly.

If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.
So many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they could get rich, 
you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing.
That's why I've never done another startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low.

If you know it's going to feel terrible sometimes, 
then when it feels terrible you won't think "ouch, this feels terrible, I give up." 
It feels that way for everyone.
And if you just hang on, things will probably get better.

81. How Not to Die
Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup
is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working. 
The reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably won't work. 
Startups almost never get it right the first time. 
Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. 
Don't assume when this happens that you've failed. 
That's normal for startups. 
But don't sit around doing nothing. Iterate.

As long as you've made something that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track. 
It will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who really love you, and startups run on morale.

So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look more closely. 
Are there zero users who really love you, 
or is there at least some little group that does? 
It's quite possible there will be zero. 
In that case, tweak your product and try again. 
Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one winning permutation somewhere in it. 
If you just keep trying, you'll find.

All of you guys already have the first two. 
You're all smart and working on promising ideas. 
Whether you end up among the living or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.

So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming. 
It always is in a startup. 
The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of disaster happening are one in a thousand. 
So don't get demoralized.

78. The Equity Equation
In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're giving up, 
the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n). 
For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 7% of your company. 
In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075. 
So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 7.5%. 
If we improve your outcome by 10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth .93 x 1.1 = 1.023.

You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other direction. 
If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, 
then they're worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n). Which means n = (i - 1)/i. 
For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker 
who's so good you feel he'll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. 
n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. 
So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him. 
That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. 
Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary and overhead as well. 
And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there's no reason to do it. 
I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. 
Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, 
and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. 
If your valuation grows 3x a year, 
the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation.

Let's run through an example. 
Suppose the company wants to make a "profit" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. 
So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his "retail" price.
Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k total.
If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.

76. The Hacker's Guide to Investors
There are several types of investors. 
The two main categories are angels and VCs: 
VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest their own.

67. How To Present to Investors
Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether you've made a compelling product. 
Before they can judge whether you've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've built. 
They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.

61. The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn
Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice.
If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast. 
What I find myself repeating is "pump out features." 
And this rule isn't just for the initial stages. 
This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.
