A list of Paul Graham's takes on the topic of startups.
The list contains the highlights of his essays from my perspective. 

I urge everyone to read through all of Paul's essays on [his website](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) as they are written really nicely
and give a lot of insights into building your own startup.

## Who is Paul Graham and why does it matter

Paul Graham is the founder of 
- Viaweb, an ecommerce creation tool before it was cool (almost 30 years ago), which was sold to Yahoo in 1998
- [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), a technology startup accelerator, which launched Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise, PagerDuty, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, Dropbox, Twitch, Flightfox, and Reddit

As part of the whole YCombinator experience, he has an enormous amount of insights within the startup ecosystem.
Apart from being a part of the YCombinator, he's also an ex-founder and knows the road to success first-hand.
